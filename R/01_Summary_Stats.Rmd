**Site 1 is excluded from all summary statistics because it was excluded from further analyses.**  


```{r}
# get rid of the 'ones' column though
dat2 <- dat %>% select(-ones)
```


## Sample Size   

```{r}
dat2 %>% 
    janitor::tabyl(habitat_type, season)
```


## Number of species  

```{r}

```


## Number of each species caught throughout sampling  

how many times was each caught, and how many individuals were caught  

```{r}
counts <- dat2 %>% 
    select(Abudefduf.saxatilis:Urophycis.floridana) %>% 
    summarize(across(.cols = everything(),
                     .fns = list(timesCaught = ~sum(.x > 0),
                                 nCaught = ~sum(.x)))) %>% 
    pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
                 names_to = c("Species", "thing"),
                 names_sep = "_") %>% 
    mutate(thing = case_when(thing == "timesCaught" ~ "Times_caught",
                             TRUE ~ "n_caught")) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = thing, values_from = value) 

```

### Most frequently caught  

```{r}
counts %>% 
    arrange(desc(Times_caught)) %>% 
    mutate(row_num = row_number()) %>% 
    select(row_num, everything()) %>% 
    filter(row_num <= 30) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```


### Most abundant  

```{r}
counts %>% 
    arrange(desc(n_caught)) %>% 
    mutate(row_num = row_number()) %>% 
    select(row_num, everything()) %>% 
    filter(row_num <= 30) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```
